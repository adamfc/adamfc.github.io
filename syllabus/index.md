#**Dear Families,**

**¡Bienvenidos a español I!** I am pleased to have your child in my
Spanish I class. I look forward to an exciting and memorable year of studying Spanish.

In this course, students will begin their journey to learning the Spanish language.  Students learn about the products, practices and perspectives of different Spanish-speaking cultures. The emphasis is on the development of four primary skills: listening, speaking, reading, and writing within a given context and extending outside of the classroom setting whenever possible. Students will look at the geography and culture of Latin America and Spain. As a way of integrating their language skills (interpretive, interpersonal, and presentational), students will design projects and do in-class presentations.

Classroom Vision and Goals
---

The following are the views of learning that we as a class will adapt as a classroom:

1.  Perserverance: I will never give up on you, so you should never give up on yourself. Practice makes perfect.
2.  Personal Growth: We all have unique strengths and weaknesses—we celebrate every leap we make, both as individuals and as a group.
3.  Compassion: As global scholars we value cross-cultural differences, and treat one another with respect.  We value our peers, our teacher, and ourselves and act accordingly in the classroom. We do not tolerate bullying.

Classroom Expectations
---

There is a zero-tolerance policy for behavior that distracts from learning. The expectations will be reviewed and posted so everything is clear for the students. Additionally, all families will receive a copy of the CMS Rights and Responsibilities Handbook. Please be sure to review this, as this is the universal handbook for Rocky River High School. The following are the expectations for my classroom:

1. Follow all directions the first time they are given.
2. Use respectful language
3. Come prepared
  - Have your materials and sharpened pencil out, be ready to learn sitting in your seat at 7:10 am.
  - Cell phones are not permitted
4. Ask questions
5. Clean up

All school rules from the **CMS Rights and Responsibilities Handbook** apply.

Homework Policy
---
Students will turn in homework to their assigned bin **before the bell rings.** If it is late, points will be deducted from the assignment. 10% will be deducted for each day it is not turned in. You have five days from the day it is late to turn it in.

Students will have five days from an excused absence in order to turn in a homework assignment. Because future homework assignments rely on each other, students will not get any extra time for future assignments, so it is highly recommended that the student complete their missing work in order to keep up with the class.

Materials Required
---
The following materials are essential to classroom success:

+ 1 Pencil, Pen, highlighter
+ 1 pack of notecards
+ 1 Three-ring Binder\*
+ 5 dividers

\**Binders will be checked after each Exam for a homework grade.*

Cell Phone Policy
---
Students are **ONLY** permitted to use technology devices before school, during class changes, at lunch, and after school, **EXCLUDING** phone calls, head phone usage, and any music/sounds coming from the device.

+ Any violation will result in **confiscation of the cell phone/ headphones/ ear buds by any staff member.** They may be picked up by the student (first offense) on Friday, after school, in the main office, with a picture ID.
+ Parents may pick up cell phones/ headphones/ earbuds up before school or after school in the main office with ID.
+ No cell phones will be given back throughout the day.

+ The student must have no more than TEN absences to receive credit for the course.
