#**Walking into class:**

In order to not be marked tardy for class, assignments will need to be turned in before class begins, and you need to be in your seat before the bell rings. Students that are inside of the classroom but not in their seats will be marked tardy. Students who do not arrive on time to class will need to report to lockout. If you are not inside of the door when the bell rings, you will report to lockout.

#**Speaking:**

I like a loud classroom, but NOT while I am speaking to the class. Disrespectfully interrupting student responses, class time, or the teacher will result in automatic removal from the class and will affect your overall grade for the day. Assignments missed due to removal from class cannot be made up.

#**Borrowing Items:**

Students who wish to borrow materials from me must exchange anything of value in exchange for a pen, pencil, highlighter, or any material they wish to borrow from me, \*unless stated otherwise by me. Once you hand back your borrowed item, I will give back your item of value.
The only exception to this procedure is that if you are instructed to collect supplies from the “Mesa de Recursos.” However, those supplies MUST be returned by the last few minutes of class.


#**Food in Class:**

Food is not permitted in the classroom unless instructed otherwise by Señorita Colombo.

#**Silent Alarm:**

If the class is being too loud, I will signal students with a raised hand or other signal in order to silence the classroom. If this does not work the first time, students will have extra homework to take home with them. If there is an individual instance where the student does not be quiet, the student will see me after class.

#**Cell Phones:**

Rule of thumb: Students have two options – cell phones must be kept inside of the pockets or inside my desk. There is no cellphone charging in the classroom. Refer to the syllabus for further information on the cell phone policy.

#**Swearing:**

Swearing will not be tolerated in this classroom. Students who are caught swearing or using inappropriate language will need to speak to me after class. More than one warning may result in referral. (Refer to Regla 2)
